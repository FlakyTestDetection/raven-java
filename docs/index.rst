Sentry for Java is the official Java SDK for Sentry. At its core it provides
a raw client for sending events to Sentry, but it is highly recommended that you
use one of the included library or framework integrations listed below if at all possible.

**Note:** The old ``raven`` library is no longer maintained. It is highly recommended that
you `migrate <https://docs.sentry.io/clients/java/migration/>`_ to ``sentry`` (which this
documentation covers). `Check out the migration guide <https://docs.sentry.io/clients/java/migration/>`_
for more information. If you are still using ``raven`` you can
`find the old documentation here <https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/blob/raven-java-8.x/docs/modules/raven.rst>`_.
